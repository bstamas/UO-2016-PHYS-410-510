Problem with using github.com on ACISS
--------------------------------------

If you clone a repository on ACISS and try to later push changes
to the repository you will encounter two problems:

1. The error message:
-----------------
error: The requested URL returned error: 403 Forbidden while accessing https://github.com/rasmussn/UO-2016-PHYS-410-510.git/info/refs

fatal: HTTP request failed
-----------------

Google will give you a hint as to the problem.  Essentially you need to add your
username to be able to authenticate.  You can find out about the remote location
with the command:

git remote -v

Fix it with the command:

git remote set-url origin https://user_name@github.com/rasmussn/UO-2016-PHYS-410-510.git


2. But then if you try to push you will get the annoying error message:

------------------
(gnome-ssh-askpass:17231): Gtk-WARNING **: cannot open display: 
------------------

Fix this by unsetting (removing) the environment variable SSH_ASKPASS:

unset SSH_ASKPASS
